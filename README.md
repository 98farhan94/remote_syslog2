# remote_syslog2

Remote_syslog tails one or more log files and sends syslog messages to a
remote central syslog server. It generates packets itself, ignoring the system
syslog daemon, so its configuration doesn't affect system-wide logging.

Uses:

 * Collecting logs from servers & daemons which don't natively support syslog
 * When reconfiguring the system logger is less convenient than a
   purpose-built daemon (e.g., automated app deployments)
 * Aggregating files not generated by daemons (e.g., package manager logs)

This code is tested with the hosted log management service
[Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com) and should work for transmitting to
any syslog server.

remote_syslog2 is a rewrite of the ruby
[remote_syslog](https://github.com/papertrail/remote_syslog) package. Not all
features of the ruby version are supported, and there are some backwards
incompatible changes.

# Installing

Precompiled binaries are coming soon. Until then, install using the
development instructions below.

# Usage

(todo)

# Development

remote_syslog2 is written in go, and uses [godep](https://github.com/kr/godep)
to manage dependencies. To get everything set up, install go then run:

    go get github.com/kr/godep

    # once the repo isn't private we can just run "go get" here
    mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/sevenscale
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sevenscale
    git clone git@github.com:sevenscale/remote_syslog2.git
    cd remote_syslog2

To run tests:

    godep go test ./...

To create a compiled executable:

    godep go build -o remote_syslog2 .

To build a tarball for release:

   ./build.sh
